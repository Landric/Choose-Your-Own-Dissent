In CHOOSE YOUR OWN DISSENT you take control of a departing splinter group of an established colony on a barely habitable alien world. You seek to create a new home, after being forced to leave the colony due to disputes with each other and the power-tripping Marshal, who seized control in the chaotic relief efforts following a natural disaster.
