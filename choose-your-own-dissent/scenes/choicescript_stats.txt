- not a numerical stat, but rather a single "property" of the character, defined during character creation one way or another

(We might want to add some to here as we think of them. They need to be ones that will conceivably be recurring)

[b]Colony:[/b]

Production / The colony's capacity to build things and get things done
Infrastructure / The colony's logistical efficiency, and the availability of electricity and shelter
Compassion / The colonists' sense of camaraderie and overall willingness to help others and work as a team
Happiness / The colonists' overall morale and extent to which their needs other than base survival are being met
Freedom / How free from relative oppression the colonists are
Nourishment / The levels of food and water available to the colony
Resources / How much raw material the colony has available to work with
Technology / A measure of how much specialist knowledge is available to the colony
Population / The number of people living in the colony, in arbitrary units
Defence / The colony and colonists' overall effectiveness in combat scenarios

///NOTE: I condensed colony resources and colony "character" stats into one. This gives us twenty stats, ten for ///the character and ten for the colony, so hopefully it won't be too overwhelming for the player. Let me know if ///there's something specific you think the stats are lacking (like a specific quality of either the character or ///colony important enough that it needs to be continually measured. I've probably forgotten something

[b]Secret:[/b]

///NOTE: I had a vision of how the game might end, or rather a couple. We can have other stats being tracked in ///the background, ones that the player may or may not be aware exists. One example that I thought of that ties ///into a potential ending is Exploration %, or how much of Aurora's surface has been explored. If we were to
///go hypothetically with that scenario where an FTL ship from Earth that left later than the Horizon but arrived
///before it screwed the planet's ecology up with a terraformation attempt, then a high Exploration % would
///dictate the chance at any given point of overall game progression for the colony to discover the remnants of
///that ship's arrival base. Alternatively, we could have them find fragments of the Horizon, or other pods, or
///somesuch.

///NOTE: Also on the subject of endings, how about launching a ship into space to investigate the still-orbiting ///wreckage of the Horizon? We can easily say that maybe only the rear half of the ship broke off and had a ///decaying orbit, and the rest is still up there with consoles, flight data, perhaps even workable stasis pods
///(though they will have powered down)
